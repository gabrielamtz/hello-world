            <p>
            My two passions in life are helping others and learning new things.
            I have always been fascinated with the process of desining and
            implementing ideas and admiring the finished product. Whether
            it had to do with technology, baking, or anything else. Fast forward
            to today, and I am on a path of changing careers, from
            being a teacher to becoming a front-end developer.

          I have been taking online courses in web development since January of
          this year, and I am loving it. When I learned how to build my first
          website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom,
          versatility, and challenges that I was looking for in my work. With
          the skills that I have gained as a teacher and my passion for learning
          and helping others, I know that I will be successful in the adventure
          of becoming a front-end developer.

          <h3> Hand-Coded HTML </h3>
              <p>
                My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 to
                make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to
                collaborate with, and accessible.

                <h3> Well-Organized CSS </h3>
                  <p>
                    I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and
                    build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load,
                    and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best
                    practices.

              <h3> Ease Converting PSD to HTML </h3>
                <p>
                  You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and
                  accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect
                  match.
